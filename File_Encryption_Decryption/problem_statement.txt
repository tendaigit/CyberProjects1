#File Encryption and Decryption

Description: Creating a program that can encrypt and decrypt text files using a symmetric encryption algorithm like the Caesar cipher or XOR encryption.

Key Concepts: Basic cryptography, file handling.

Libraries: None (for simple algorithms).

Steps:
Implement a basic encryption algorithm.
Allow users to select a file, encrypt it, and save the result.
Provide a decryption option to reverse the process.
